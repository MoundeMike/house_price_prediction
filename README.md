# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on selected
property features. It demonstrates a regression-based ML workflow using Python,
from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that can estimate house prices given relevant
housing attributes.


## Workflow
- Dataset loading and inspection
- Feature and target variable separation
- Train-test split
- Model training using a regression algorithm
- Model evaluation on test data
- Price prediction

## Model Used
- XGBoost

## Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using regression metrics to assess how well
predicted prices align with actual house prices.
